  "The reverse-complement quotient of a de Bruijn graph is a signed graph,
   and its critical group is not an assembly invariant"

THE QUESTION (Bio 6, Rem. 7; monograph Ch. 26, Open 7).  Bio 6 built the reverse-complement
DOUBLE COVER D_k of a de Bruijn graph and showed that the involution rho(v) = vbar carries
D_k to its OPPOSITE digraph, so rho induces no endomorphism of K(D_k) and the cover does not
descend.  The obvious repair is to pass to the QUOTIENT and to use Zaslavsky's signed
Laplacian Delta = D - A_sigma there.  Does that give a sandpile theory of double-stranded
assembly?  Does the r-bundle chain splitting of Bio 3 survive?  Do E. coli's seven rRNA
operons merge into one 7-fold object?

THE ANSWERS.  Three yes and three no, and the no's are the theorems.

YES.
  1. rho is free on V(D_k) exactly when S has no self-reverse-complementary repeated k-mer.
     For ODD k that is automatic (the middle base would have to be its own complement), so
     Sigma_k := D_k/rho is a signed graph for every odd k.  For even k it can fail, and does:
     phiX174 has 3 palindromic repeated 10-mers and 1 palindromic repeated 12-mer, and at
     those k the quotient adjacency is not even symmetric.
  2. All r parallel edges of a bundle of Sigma_k carry the SAME sign, because the sign
     eps(u)eps(v) depends only on the endpoints.  Hence Sigma_k has honest r-bundles and
     K(Sigma_k) (Reiner-Tseng: im d / im Delta, an index-2 subgroup of coker Delta when
     Sigma_k is unbalanced) is a switching invariant of the genome.
  3. Sigma_k is UNBALANCED iff S carries an inverted repeat of length >= k.  This is
     Zaslavsky balance read through Bio 6's connectivity criterion: the signed double cover
     is disconnected exactly when the base is balanced (Reiner-Tseng, Prop. 11.4-11.5).

NO.
  4. THE DIGRAPH CARRIES NO COVERING THEORY.  With P the permutation matrix of rho,
     P Delta(D_k) P = Delta(D_k)^t and NOT Delta(D_k).  The deck involution is an
     ANTI-automorphism of the Laplacian, so the +-1 eigenlattices of P are not Delta-stable
     and Reiner-Tseng's exact sequence has no directed analogue.  Numerically K(D_k) is not
     an extension of anything by K(Sigma_k): for phiX174 at k = 11, |K(D_11)| = 25318912
     while |K(|D_11|)| = |K(Sigma_11)| |K(|Sigma_11|)| = 19738255595056.
  5. THE BUNDLE CHAIN DOES NOT CONTRACT.  In a digraph the chain row is r(x_t - x_{t+1}),
     which kills one difference outright: Bio 3's (Z/r)^{s-1} (+) K(G/C).  In a signed graph
     the row is r(d_{t-1} - d_t) with d_t = x_t - x_{t+1}, which kills only SECOND
     differences.  The s second differences do give an r-torsion subgroup of rank s, but the
     residual first difference couples to the rest of the graph by the SERIES law: the row at
     the chain's endpoint a differs between Sigma and Sigma/C by exactly s r d_0.  Hence
     K(Sigma) is NOT (Z/r)^s (+) K(Sigma/C), and the chain contraction that makes the E. coli
     computation of Bio 5 feasible has no bidirected analogue.
  6. SO THE MERGE THE QUESTION ASKS FOR CANNOT COUNT ANYTHING.  The seven rRNA operons DO
     merge into a single 7-bundle chain of Sigma_k -- that part works.  But K(Sigma_k) is an
     invariant of the UNDIRECTED shadow, and by the matrix-tree theorem it counts spanning
     trees, not Eulerian circuits.  BEST needs the digraph, which by (4) has no quotient.
     The 7-fold structure is visible instead as F_7-nullity, which is what we report.

 (P)  rho is free iff no palindromic repeated k-mer; automatic for odd k             exact
 (W)  bundles have constant sign; K(Sigma_k) is switching invariant                  exact
 (B)  Sigma_k unbalanced iff S has an inverted repeat of length >= k                 exact
 (R)  Reiner-Tseng 0 -> K(Sigma_k) -> K(|D_k|) -> K(|Sigma_k|) -> 0, orders multiply
      and the 2-primary part is a NON-SPLIT extension                                exact
 (N)  P Delta P = Delta^t but P Delta P != Delta, and K(D_k) misses the sequence      exact
 (D)  what rho gives instead is a SYMMETRIC Bowen-Franks linking form on K(D_k); the
      relevant notion is a metabolizer, not a Lagrangian, and for phiX174 the order
      is not a perfect square, so no metabolizer exists                              exact
 (C)  K(Sigma) != (Z/r)^s (+) K(Sigma/C); the defect is the series law               exact
 (E)  E. coli K-12: the seven rRNA operons merge into 7-bundles of Sigma_k whose longest
      chain spans 728 bp at k = 31, 51 and 75 alike -- the same block Bio 6 matched
      one-to-one onto the seven rrn operons, and at k = 51 the same length s = 678 --
      and their only quantitative trace is the F_7-nullity of Delta_{Sigma_k}        exact
