rc_double_cover.py -- the reverse-complement double cover of a de Bruijn graph

    "Double strands without a new lemma: the reverse-complement double cover"   (Bio 6)

THE OBJECT.  For a circular sequence S with reverse complement Sbar, let D_k(S) be the
multidigraph whose vertices are the k-mers occurring in S or in Sbar and whose arcs are
the occurrences of (k+1)-mers in S AND in Sbar.  Then

    mult_D(v) = mult_S(v) + mult_S(vbar)   and   d+(v) = d-(v) = mult_D(v),

so D_k is BALANCED.  Every result of Bio 1-3 therefore applies to it verbatim: the unitig
lemma, the bundle-chain lemma, the splitting theorem.  No bidirected lemma is needed for
the double cover -- the bidirected QUOTIENT is a different object and stays open.

WHAT CHANGES.  A repeat family with a copies on the forward strand and b on the reverse
has multiplicity a in G_k(S) and b for its reverse complement, but a + b in D_k.  That is
the whole content of "the strands merge": the seven rRNA operons of E. coli, split 5 + 2
by strand and so invisible as a seven-copy family on one strand, are one multiplicity-7
family in D_k (and again as its rho-image).

rho(v) = vbar reverses arcs, so it is an isomorphism D_k -> D_k^op.  Since Delta^op =
Delta^T for a balanced digraph, and Tor coker M is canonically dual to Tor coker M^T
(Paper VIII, Lem 1.5), rho equips K(D_k) with a canonical PERFECT PAIRING.  That is the
structure that replaces the +-1 eigenspace splitting Bio 1 warned against: an involution
does not split the group, but this one dualises it.

 (B)  D_k is balanced with mult_D(v) = mult_S(v) + mult_S(vbar)                 exact
 (C)  D_k is connected iff S has an inverted repeat of length >= k; the witness
      is exhibited                                                              exact
 (R)  rho is an isomorphism D_k -> D_k^op: P A P^t = A^t on the compacted graph  exact
 (M)  strand merging: a + b copies across strands give multiplicity a + b in D_k;
      the seven rRNA operons of E. coli become one 7-copy family                exact
 (K)  K(D_k) exactly for phiX174, beside K(G_k)                                 exact
 (E)  E. coli: the decomposition of D_k at several k                      exact/numeric
